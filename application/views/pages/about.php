		<h4>About</h4>
		<p>
			This application was created to dynamically shows users the top five scorers in Indiana Boys Basketball, and gives users the ability to see game-by-game scoring information about any of those players in a very simple format. The data is scraped 
dynamically from Varvee.com for every page load. 
		</p>
		<h4>Technology</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>CodeIgniter framework on LAMP Stack</li>
			<li>Bootstrap</li>
			<li>HTML5 Boilerplate</li>
			<li>Responsive</li>
			<li>CI Unit Tester</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Testing Strategy</h4>
		<p>Since this application is parsed from Varvee's website, it is important to catch different kind of errors related to structure changes on Varvee's website. To automate this, I implemented testing script using CodeIgniter basic unit tester to catch error 
related to changes on html page, table column, and even url. For more detail regarding the test case and the result of the automated testing, go ahead and jump straight to the <a href="/vnn/test/">unit test</a> page
